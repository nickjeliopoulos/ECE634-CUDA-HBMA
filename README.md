# ECE634 Final Project - CUDA C++ Hierarchical Block Matching (HBMA)
</div>

<div align="center">

Efficient implementation of HBMA algorithm designed and optimized for an XXX GPU.
A naive kernel `hbma_v0` was first implemented, with iterative improvements `v1`, `v2`, etc. to illustrate various design decisions and their resulting speedups.
